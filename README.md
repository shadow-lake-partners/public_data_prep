# public_data_prep

This repo contains a serios of Python scripts for downloading public data and adding it to a database for analysis. In this case, all data is written to SQLite, but this could obviously be changed to suit another database. SQLite is used here to compliment and prepare data for further use and analysis in Simon Wilson's awesome [Datasette](git@github.com:shadow-lake-partners/public_data_prep.git) tool.
